# Context-Free Grammar Processing and LL(1) Parsing

## Overview
This project implements a C program to process a **Context-Free Grammar (CFG)** and perform the following tasks:  
1. **Left Factoring** – Eliminates common prefixes to prepare the grammar for predictive parsing.  
2. **Left Recursion Removal** – Removes direct and indirect left recursion.  
3. **FIRST Set Computation** – Computes FIRST sets for all non-terminals.  
4. **FOLLOW Set Computation** – Computes FOLLOW sets for all non-terminals.  
5. **LL(1) Parsing Table Construction** – Generates an LL(1) parsing table based on FIRST and FOLLOW sets.
